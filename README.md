## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **AI Data Engineer and Machine Learning enthusiast** currently pursuing my **MS in Computer Science at San José State University**. Before grad school, I worked as a Senior Consultant at Ernst & Young LLP - building large‑scale data systems, automating enterprise workflows, and helping teams make better decisions with real‑time analytics.

I love working at the intersection of **big data, ML systems, backend engineering, and cloud infrastructure** — basically anywhere I can build something scalable, intelligent, and a little bit fun.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me rock climbing, hiking or travelling.
